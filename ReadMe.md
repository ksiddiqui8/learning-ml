This repo contains all the data and the jupyter notebooks that I used to learn ML. I followed the online course created by Kylie Young, in collaboration with freecodecamp.org (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_LwzRVP7bg&pp=ygUpbWFjaGluZSBsZWFybmluZyBmb3IgZXZlcnlvbmUga3lsaWUgeW91bmc%3D) and used the following datasets:

1. MAGIC Gamma Telescope data for classification (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/159/magic+gamma+telescope)
2. Seoul Bike Sharing Demand data for regression (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/560/seoul+bike+sharing+demand)
3. Seeds data for unsupervised learning (clustering) (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/236/seeds)
